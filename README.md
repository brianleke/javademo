# JAVA PROJECT DEMONSTRATING MAVEN WITH TRAVIS AND COVERALLS INTEGRATION

This project demonstrates how a typical **Java Mvn project** is structured together with the unit tests using the **JUnit 4.12** framework together with the **Harmcrest matchers**. For CI the project uses [TravisCI](https://www.travis-ci.org/brianleke/javademo "Travis CI Build For Project") and exports the coverage report to [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/github/brianleke/javademo?branch=master "Coverage Metrics For Project").

Build Status: [![Build Status](https://www.travis-ci.org/brianleke/javademo.svg?branch=master)](https://www.travis-ci.org/brianleke/javademo)

Coverage Status: [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/brianleke/javademo/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/brianleke/javademo?branch=master)


This is meant purely for demonstration purposes.
